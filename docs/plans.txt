A Flask app to help manage my use of all my AI subscriptions

Initital prompt: I have the full suite of jetBrains IDEs. I like Pycharm and InteliJ. I also use VS code. The AIs I have accounts with: 1. ChatGPT Plus account. 2. SuperGrok plan (Everything in basic, larger context memory 128,000 tokens 3. Gemini Pro. 4. Perplexity Pro. 5. Claude Code Pro. 5. OpenArt Advanced 6. Suno Pro 7. Bandlab I will be doing the following tasks. 1. Developing game apps for Android and windows. 2. Creating digital art to be printed as giclee prints. 3. Creating new music. Give me some recommendations on how to manage all of this? Would something like n8n help? Or, what if I developed my own app that either had their own prompt windows, or at least had account status, email used, monthly cost, and links for all my AIs. I could add texting with recommended ways to use. Or, what if I had one aI I used to create the prompts for a specific AI. For example, maybe this app talks to Perplexity and says, "Hey, I want to create a new high quality image based on one of my jpegs. What should the flow be?" Or, "I want to create a new app based on the mobile game Toon Blast, give me initial prompts to start."

You’re basically running a small “AI studio,” so you’ll be happiest if you treat this like a system: clear roles for each tool, one place to track them, and some automation on top. [hatchworks](https://hatchworks.com/blog/ai-agents/n8n-guide/)

## 1. Give each AI a clear job

This avoids overlap and cuts decision fatigue.

- **Game dev (Android/Windows, npm + Python/Flask)**
  - JetBrains AI (PyCharm/IntelliJ): inline refactors, code explanations, test suggestions, small edits while you’re in the IDE. [jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/licensing-and-subscriptions.html)
  - Claude Code Pro: deep repo work, multi‑file changes, architecture/debugging sessions for the solitaire and match games. [truefoundry](https://www.truefoundry.com/blog/claude-code-limits-explained)
  - ChatGPT / Gemini / Grok / Perplexity: design docs, algorithm ideas, level design, UX flows, tech stack questions. Use whichever feels best per task but default to *one* as your “research brain” to reduce context‑switching. [wrangleai](https://wrangleai.com/blog/how-to-reduce-llm-spend/)

- **Digital art (giclée prints)**
  - OpenArt Advanced: main image generator; use others only when you hit a limitation.
  - Perplexity / ChatGPT: prompt crafting (“turn this idea + reference JPEG into a detailed prompt for OpenArt”). [docs.n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/intro-tutorial/)

- **Music**
  - Suno Pro, BandLab: core generation and production.
  - Text AIs (Perplexity/ChatGPT/Claude): lyric prompts, song structure ideas, marketing copy.

If you like the “one AI to create prompts for another” idea, pick **one text‑first model (e.g., Perplexity or ChatGPT)** as your “prompt engineer” and use it consistently for that purpose.

## 2. Central “control panel” app is worth building

Your idea of your own app with status, cost, and links is excellent and lightweight.

Minimum useful feature set:

- A small **“AI inventory” dashboard** with:
  - Service name (Claude Code, ChatGPT, etc.).
  - Email used.
  - Plan (e.g., Pro, Plus, Free).
  - Monthly cost and renewal date.
  - Quick links (billing page, docs, web app).
- Optional: simple tags like `coding`, `art`, `music`, `prompting` so you can filter by task.

You can build this as:

- A **local web app** (Flask/FastAPI + small DB or JSON), or
- A simple desktop tool (Electron/Tauri) with just a config file behind it.

This alone helps you see “total AI spend per month” and stop accidental subscription creep. [aizolo](https://aizolo.com/blog/ai-subscription-bundles-the-smart-solution-to-managing-multiple-ai-tools-in-2025/)

## 3. Use n8n (or similar) for automation, not as your main UI

n8n is great for *connecting* tools and building reusable workflows, not necessarily as your daily “prompt console.” [n8n](https://n8n.io)

Where n8n would help you:

- **Standard flows for art**
  - Workflow: “When I drop a JPEG in folder X → call Perplexity to create an OpenArt prompt → send to OpenArt API → save result to folder Y and log to a Google Sheet.” [n8n](https://n8n.io/workflows/categories/ai/)
- **Standard flows for game dev**
  - Workflow: “On git push to branch `level-design` → call Perplexity to summarize changes → call Claude/ChatGPT to propose test cases → post into your task system or email.” [hatchworks](https://hatchworks.com/blog/ai-agents/n8n-guide/)
- **Account monitoring**
  - Poll API usage endpoints where available, and push a weekly summary: “You used X tokens on Claude, Y on OpenArt this week.” [prompts](https://www.prompts.ai/blog/the-most-efficient-ai-tool-platforms-for-multiple-llms)

You can absolutely combine: your own small “AI console” app for human‑facing info + n8n in the background for automations.

## 4. Use one AI to design flows and prompts

Your suggested pattern is strong and cost‑efficient:

- Example 1:
  - To Perplexity: “I want to use OpenArt to upscale and remix this JPEG into a giclée‑quality image. Outline the steps AND write 3 prompts optimized for OpenArt.”
  - Then copy those prompts into OpenArt.

- Example 2:
  - To your “prompt engineer” AI: “I want to build a Toon Blast‑style game; generate initial prompts I can paste into Claude Code to set up project scaffolding and architecture.”

Once you like a flow (for art, music, or code), that’s a good candidate to **encode in n8n** so it’s one click next time instead of re‑typing.

## 5. Add budgeting and guardrails

You have many paid plans, so add some very explicit constraints:

- In your “AI console” app, store:
  - **Monthly budget per category**: coding, art, music.
  - **Preferred tool order** per task (e.g., “for generic coding questions → ChatGPT; for repo edits → Claude Code; for in‑IDE help → JetBrains”).
- Simple behavior rules:
  - If a service hits quota or asks you to top up beyond the monthly budget, switch to the next tool in the chain instead of paying more that month. [neos](https://www.neos.hr/jetbrains-ai-quotas-keep-development-running-without-surprises/)
  - Check subscription list once a month and cancel anything you didn’t use meaningfully.

You could even have your app send yourself a text: “You’re at 80% of your coding AI budget this month; consider switching to free/cheaper models.”

## 6. Concrete setup for your three workstreams

**Game apps (Android/Windows)**
- Design & architecture: Perplexity or ChatGPT.
- Implementation & refactors: Claude Code in VS Code or JetBrains AI in PyCharm/IntelliJ, depending on language.
- Automation: n8n to summarize git activity, create TODOs, and log decisions.

**Digital art (giclée)**
- Prompt design: Perplexity or ChatGPT (one of them consistently).
- Generation: OpenArt Advanced.
- Automation: n8n flows triggered when files land in a “source art” folder.

**Music**
- Structure/lyrics/ideas: Perplexity/ChatGPT.
- Audio: Suno Pro for generation, BandLab for arrangement/mixing.
- Automation: n8n can archive finished tracks, back up stems, and generate release notes via LLM.

***

If you want, I can sketch a very simple data model and UI wireframe for your “AI control panel” app (fields, views, and a JSON format) so you can build it quickly in Flask/React or straight in a JetBrains project.

Here’s a minimal, buildable design for your “AI control panel” app you can implement in Flask + React (or any stack you like).

## 1. Core data model

Think “accounts” plus a few helper concepts.

### Entities

**AIService**

- `id` (string): internal ID, e.g. `"chatgpt_plus"`.
- `name` (string): `"ChatGPT Plus"`.
- `category` (enum): `"coding" | "art" | "music" | "general"`.
- `provider` (string): `"OpenAI"`, `"Anthropic"`, `"JetBrains"`, `"Google"`, etc.
- `website_url` (string).
- `docs_url` (string | null).
- `billing_url` (string | null).

**AIAccount**

- `id` (string or UUID).
- `service_id` (FK → `AIService.id`).
- `email` (string).
- `plan_name` (string): `"Pro"`, `"Plus"`, `"Free"`, `"SuperGrok"`, etc.
- `monthly_cost_usd` (number).
- `renewal_day` (int 1–31, or null for “month‑to‑month/unknown”).
- `status` (enum): `"active" | "paused" | "cancelled"`.
- `notes` (string): free‑form notes.
- `tags` (string[]): e.g. `["primary_coding", "prompt_engineer"]`.

**UsageBudget**

- `id` (UUID).
- `account_id` (FK → `AIAccount.id`).
- `monthly_budget_usd` (number).
- `alert_threshold_percent` (number, e.g. 80).
- `current_month_spend_usd` (number; you can update manually or via automation later).

**RecommendationSnippet** (optional but useful for your “texting with recommended ways to use” idea)

- `id` (UUID).
- `account_id` (FK) or `service_id` (FK) – you can pick one.
- `title` (string): `"When to use Claude Code vs JetBrains AI"`.
- `body` (string): a short paragraph or bullet list.
- `priority` (int): 1–5 to sort suggestions.

## 2. Example JSON structure

Single JSON export that your app can load/save:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "chatgpt_plus",
      "name": "ChatGPT Plus",
      "category": "general",
      "provider": "OpenAI",
      "website_url": "https://chat.openai.com",
      "docs_url": "https://platform.openai.com/docs",
      "billing_url": "https://platform.openai.com/account/billing"
    },
    {
      "id": "claude_code_pro",
      "name": "Claude Code Pro",
      "category": "coding",
      "provider": "Anthropic",
      "website_url": "https://code.claude.com",
      "docs_url": "https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview",
      "billing_url": "https://claude.ai/settings/billing"
    }
  ],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": "acc_001",
      "service_id": "chatgpt_plus",
      "email": "you@example.com",
      "plan_name": "Plus",
      "monthly_cost_usd": 20,
      "renewal_day": 3,
      "status": "active",
      "notes": "Primary general LLM for brainstorming.",
      "tags": ["general", "prompt_engineer"]
    },
    {
      "id": "acc_002",
      "service_id": "claude_code_pro",
      "email": "you@example.com",
      "plan_name": "Pro",
      "monthly_cost_usd": 17,
      "renewal_day": 10,
      "status": "active",
      "notes": "Use only for repo‑aware coding sessions.",
      "tags": ["coding", "deep_repo"]
    }
  ],
  "usage_budgets": [
    {
      "id": "bud_001",
      "account_id": "acc_002",
      "monthly_budget_usd": 30,
      "alert_threshold_percent": 80,
      "current_month_spend_usd": 12
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "id": "rec_001",
      "account_id": "acc_002",
      "title": "When to use Claude Code",
      "body": "Use for multi‑file refactors and architecture work; for simple Q&A or language questions, default to ChatGPT or Perplexity instead.",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

You can start with just `services` and `accounts` and add the rest later.

## 3. UI wireframe (screens)

### Screen A: Dashboard (home)

Goals: see everything at a glance, plus total spend.

- Top section:
  - “Total monthly AI spend: $XXX” (sum of `monthly_cost_usd` of active accounts).
  - “Coding / Art / Music breakdown” (simple text or small bar: e.g., Coding $X, Art $Y, Music $Z).
- Account list (table):
  - Columns: Service, Plan, Email, Monthly Cost, Category, Status.
  - Row click → goes to Account Detail.
  - Filters: by category (coding/art/music/general), by status (active/paused).
- Quick actions:
  - Button: “Add new AI account”.
  - Button: “Export JSON” / “Import JSON”.

### Screen B: Account Detail

For a specific AI account (e.g., Claude Code Pro).

Sections:

- Header:
  - Service name, plan, category chips (e.g., “Coding”).
- Basic info:
  - Email, monthly cost, renewal day, status dropdown.
  - Tags (editable chips).
- Links:
  - Buttons: “Open Web App”, “Open Docs”, “Open Billing”.
- Budget & usage (if you use UsageBudget):
  - Monthly budget input and current spend.
  - Simple text: “You’re at 40% of your $30 budget this month.”
- Recommendations:
  - Small list of “How I use this” text blocks with an edit button.

### Screen C: Task‑based view (optional, but nice)

This is where your “recommended ways to use” per task lives.

Top: three tiles:

- “Coding (apps & games)”
- “Art (giclée & images)”
- “Music”

Click “Coding” → show:

- A short explanation: “For coding tasks, you primarily use Claude Code, JetBrains, ChatGPT…”
- A checklist of typical flows, e.g.:
  - “High‑level design: Perplexity / ChatGPT”
  - “Repo edits: Claude Code”
  - “Inline suggestions: JetBrains AI”

This is mostly static config you can define in JSON or in code.

## 4. Implementation sketch (Flask + React)

Very high level:

**Backend (Flask)**

- Store the JSON in a file or SQLite; create endpoints:
  - `GET /api/config` → returns whole JSON.
  - `POST /api/config` → saves updated JSON.
  - Optionally: `PATCH /api/accounts/:id`, etc., if you want granularity.

**Frontend (React or similar)**

- On load, fetch `/api/config`.
- Manage app state client‑side (services, accounts, budgets, recommendations).
- Components for: Dashboard, Account List, Account Detail, Task View.
- When you make edits, send updated JSON back to backend.

You can prototype this in one JetBrains project (e.g., PyCharm for Flask backend + React frontend in a `frontend/` folder).

## 5. Where “one AI to prompt another” fits

In your model, you can:

- Add a boolean flag on `AIService`: `can_prompt_others: true/false`.
- In the Task view, pre‑store flows like:

  - “Art from JPEG”:
    1. Ask Perplexity: “Turn this idea into an OpenArt prompt…”
    2. Paste prompt into OpenArt.

You don’t need to automate this immediately; just show the flows as **text recipes** in your UI so you remember the preferred pattern.

If you want, next step I can outline specific fields and routes if you choose a different stack (e.g., a pure Python TUI, or an Electron app) instead of Flask/React.Lw
